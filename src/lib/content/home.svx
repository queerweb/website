# The Queer Web

Hi! The Queer Web is an initative to bring free services to queer folks on the web. We are currently working on offering free secure file storage and sharing, with plans to expand to more services such as hosting and email in the near future.

We support the open web and think everyone deserves freedom on the internet, even queer people. We are financially transparent and completely open source


## Projects/Services

<Project 
	name="notes.gay" 
	link="https://github.com/example/queerweb"
